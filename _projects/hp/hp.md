While at Iris I led a number of content strategy programs for HP Inc., including their global sales channel realignment, the Tech@Work newsletter which regularly reached 5+ million subscribers, and the launch of the HP Partner First program.

## Global Sales Channel

I led the writing and content strategy for the HP Inc. global channel sales group, helping realign the HP Inc. brand after their split from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.

Working closely with HP Inc. leadership, I used contextual inquiry and frequent design cycles to develop literature, presentations and infographics that resonated with target audiences.

## Tech@Work

HP's Technology at Work (Tech@Work) newsletter targets small and medium businesses with in-depth articles on IT trends, tips, and new product information. 

I developed a content strategy that regularly reached 5+ million readers in the US and Canada and millions more worldwide, consistently making Tech@Work HPâ€™s most successful content marketing venture.

## Partner First

I led the content strategy for the HP Partner First program messaging, key value proposition, and onboarding guide. This global program encompassed compensation, training, sales resources, development funds, marketing assets, and financial resources. 

In addition, I led content development of supplemental sales training resources and videos.
