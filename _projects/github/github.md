My self-initiated coding projects have included:

## Publishing House Macro Collection
I created a series of Visual Basic for Applications programs used in production at InterVarsity Press, including a scripture indexing program, British to American English conversion program, punctuation helper program, and house style program (later distributed on SourceForge with GPLv2 licensing, attracting ~1,500 downloads).

## American Cabinet Appointments
I researched, designed, and coded the first-ever comprehensive dataset of United States Presidential Cabinet appointments, including service dates, education levels, military service, gender and minority status, and confirmation votes.

## FlightCALC
I created Python classes for TSA Security Checkpoint Wait Time and Google Maps Distance Matrix APIs to estimate when to leave for a flight based on live conditions (distributed on GitHub with BSD 2 licensing).
