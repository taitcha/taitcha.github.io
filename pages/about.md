*I combine content strategy with UX research and design to make things, better.*

### Preparation

From Fortune 50 tech companies to really long hiking trails, I have a history of following through. I started out in advertising, working my way up from creative to strategy. Then I added UX design and research into the mix to better solve user needs.

### Process

Research. Prototype. Iterate. Products people love come from deeply listening to users. And even on a small budget, a user-centered process produces better results in less time. Yes, methods change—not every job needs participatory design workshops—but the process is always worthwhile.

### Passion

Good causes deserve good design. I spend a lot of my time off working with  communities, law enforcement, local and national government agencies, and other public and private agencies. I'm particularly interested in the interplay between civic technology and government services.
